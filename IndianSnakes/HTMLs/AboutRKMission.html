<p>1984	All Karnataka Youth Convension had occurred at the <a href="http://www.rkmathbangalore.org/rkm/">Ramakrishna Math, Bangalore</a> (then Sri Ramakrishna Ashrama, Bangalore). Around 3000 delegates participated and a decision to undertake Rural Development work in a nearby village was taken. In August 1984 a mobile medical unit was started. In January 1985 "Sri Ramakrishna Grama Kshema Trust" by the devotees of the Math was formed. In May 1985 <a href="http://www.rkmission-shivanahalli.org/rkv.html">Sri Ramakrishna Vidya Kendra</a>, a Kannada primary school upto Std IV (now upto std. VII) was started. In November 1996 Ramakrishna Grama Kshema Trust was dissolved and all the activities with the assets were handed over to Ramakrishna Mission, Shivanahalli</p>
