<p>Meeting place for all those who are interested in Snakes of India.<br />
Members can share their Photos, Videos, Rescue experiences, Snake bite cases and all related matters to understand them better for their conservation and positive relations with humans. </p>
<p>We support balance between ethical, sensitive, scientific way of treatment so our way is flexible and so members need to keep visiting for better idea of snake world. </p>
<p>We don't encourage these things:<br />
- New group of rescue and training of rescue/capturing snakes.<br />
- Snake breeding or its knowledge.<br />
- Snake handling or misbehaving photos.<br />
- Big part of photos from Internet specially those without any particular reason to post for discussion.<br />
- Snake bite treatment by commenting on symptoms. </p>
<p>Following are the things Admins and other members expect:<br />
- Location and other details of content.<br />
- Humble, curious, supportive and generous response.<br />
- More scientific/educative and less "typical snake lover" sign from each other. </p>
