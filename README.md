# IndianSnakes-iOS
Indian Snakes iOS app built on Swift

The app pulls data from http://indiansnakes.org. The open source code, however, pulls data from http://development.indiansnakes.org only. The production build alone will have authentication keys from http://indiansnakes.org which contains the actual data.

All developer documentation is available in the wiki: https://github.com/gumdal/IndianSnakes-iOS/wiki
